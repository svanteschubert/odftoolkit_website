<h3 id="what-is-the-ppmc">What is the PPMC?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-the-ppmc" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The Podling Project Management Committee (PPMC) is the government of the project. It
consists of ASF mentors and initial committers. The committee is responsible for the
project and decides what to do and which direction to go.
<br> (<a href="http://incubator.apache.org/guides/ppmc.html">see here for more information</a>)</p>
<h3 id="how-to-participate">How to participate?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-participate" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>First of all you have to think how you want to participate as we have different kind
of roles like user, developer, committer. The easiest way is to use what we build as
user. If you want to improve parts of the software, or documentation, write to our
<a href="http://incubator.apache.org/odftoolkit/mailing-lists.html">mailing lists</a> what should be modified and how it should be done.</p>
<p>The following are conditions to become a committer:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have sent in patches that were well-respected to improve the software.</li>
<li>You have added documentation to the Wiki or website that were well-respected to
    improve the non-code part of the project.</li>
<li>You have shown that you can discuss in the mailing lists and that this has
    brought us forward.</li>
<li>You are well known to the established members, who you are and what you have
    done in the past. Regarding this project, a former-one or another project.</li>
</ol>
<p>If 1 of the 4 statements above are true, then you can be voted in as committer.</p>
<p>When the vote result is positive, you will be asked for some information to setup
your committer status.
<br> (<a href="http://incubator.apache.org/guides/participation.html">see here for more information</a>)</p>
<h3 id="i-was-invitedvoted-as-committer-so-whats-next">I was invited/voted as committer, so whats next?<a class="headerlink" href="#i-was-invitedvoted-as-committer-so-whats-next" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The following is a brief summary of what to expect as committer:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>After your (individual Contributor License Agreement (<a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt">iCLA</a>) has been
    received and registered, you will be invited to specify one or more preferred
    Apache user names.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: <br>
The e-mail address you provide in your iCLA will be used for the following
communications with you.</p>
<p>Please note that there is also a <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/cla-corporate.txt">Corporate Contributor License Agreement
(CCLA)</a> if you want/have to commit in the name of a company or organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose one or more user name(s) that would be acceptable to you. These are short
    names or abbreviation that will be used for a Unix account login.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <br>
Your name is "John Doe", so an ID could be "johnd" or "jdoe". <a href="http://people.apache.org/committer-index.html">Here you can see
if the ID is still free</a> or already given to another committer.</p>
<p>Supply all other information that is requested. Return the ID requests as
instructed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When your choices are returned, the first request that does not conflict with
    an already-issued ID will be used to generate an Apache ID. Write them in
    the order you would like to have, so the first one is the most wanted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will receive an e-mail, from "root@apache.org", that confirms the Apache
    user name for you and also provides you with an initial password. There are also
    instructions for changing your password. Please be patient as this mail can take
    some days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ID will also be your Apache e-mail address. Note that the account will be
    set up to forward all received mails to the e-mail address you supplied on your
    iCLA. It is not a normal mail account but just for forwarding. After you have
    the account there is also a way to associate your Apache e-mail address with
    additional e-mail addresses that you have. (<strong>ToDo</strong>: Add a link to a how-to)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ID and password will allow you to check in changes and new additions on the
    Apache SVN repository for the ODF Toolkit incubator repository. The ability
    to check in material on the SVN repository is important for more than code. All
    committers will have an use for it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ID and password will allow you to login to a personal Unix account on the
    Apache server "people.apache.org". You can produce a personal website at this
    account as well as use it as a regular Unix (specifically, FreeBSD) account. You
    do not need to be able to use this account. You may find it useful as you become
    more accomplished as a committer.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being a committer also grants access to some non-public resources and mailing
    lists. There are details in the <a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/committers">private committers SVN tree</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>See the <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/new-committers-guide.html">Guide for new committers</a> and the <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/committers.html">Committers' FAQ</a> for more information.</p>
<h3 id="how-and-when-to-vote">How and when to vote?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-and-when-to-vote" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Voting is done when a formal decision has to be made or due to legal reasons, e.g.,
to vote in new members as committers. In any case avoid voting as the normal way is
to come to a decision by discussions. The initiator is responsible for the vote,
that means also to count the votes and present the result. Every member has 1 vote.

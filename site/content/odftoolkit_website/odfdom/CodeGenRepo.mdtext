Title: Code Generation as a Separate Component
We are moving toward treating the code generator as a separate component. The repository [http://odftoolkit.org/hg/odfdom~relaxng2template][1] is the new home of the code generator. It may move to its own project on this site at some point.

This will be the first part of ODFDOM to be a maven-only build and release.

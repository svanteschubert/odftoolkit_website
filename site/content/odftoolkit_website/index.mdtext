**Mission Statement**

The ODF Toolkit is a set of Java modules that allow programmatic creation,
scanning and manipulation of [Open Document Format] [1] (ISO/IEC 26300 == ODF)
documents. Unlike other approaches which rely on runtime manipulation
of heavy-weight editors via an automation interface, the ODF Toolkit
is lightweight and ideal for server use.

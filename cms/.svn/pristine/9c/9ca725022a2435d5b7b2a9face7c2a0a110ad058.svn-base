ASF CMS STATUS

Currently in production for ~5 dozen projects, at version 1.x, and ready
for wide-scale adoption.  The only feature currently lacking is support
for per-branch staging builds, but we'll get there.

So, How do I use this damned thing?

To build stuff you need the build/ subdir.  The relevant scripts
are build_file.pl and build_site.pl.  There are only a few modest perl
prereqs, but the odd one to pick up is the python markdown package.
Be sure to set your MARKDOWN_SOCKET env var to something appropriate
for both the build scripts and build/markdownd.py, and to pick up the
python Pygments package for codehilighting support.  To get the daemon
started (*nix only) just invoke ./markdownd.py from within the build dir.

See http://www.apache.org/dev/cmsref.html#local-build for details on the
python prereqs.

There are some conversion utilities for converting sources to markdown.
For anakia based stuff use 

% xsltproc conversion-utilities/anakia2markdown.xslt path/to/xml/source.xml \
  | ./conversion-utilities/wraptext.pl > path/to/markdown/file.mdtext

(there are a few caveats with this, one being that the xml source file needs
to contain an enveloping <section> block for the actual content).

Also, be sure to add

*.mdtext = svn:eol-style=native

to your ~/.subversion/config file.


More stuff in conversion-utilities/cwiki related to confluence migration
is ongoing.


SETUP
=====

0) Read the pod documentation in webgui/lib/ASF/CMS.pm to get a general feel
for what needs local modification.

1) From CPAN I had to install (you only need these if you're building the www site):

sudo perl -MCPAN -e shell
install XML::RSS::Parser::Lite
install XML::Atom

If you want restructured text support:

install Text::Restructured

* you may need to "force install Text::Restructured" - was necessary on my box.


2) Checkout CMS

svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/websites/cms apache-cms

3) Checkout the project's site repo

svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/<project>/site/trunk svn_<project>_site


SITE GENERATION
===============

1) cd into the project site repo

2) mkdir t

3) run CMS site generation

../apache-cms/build/build_site.pl --source-base . --target-base ./t

(whatever the relative path is to build_site.pl)

4) open t/index.html in a browser


TODO
====

Migrate the wmd stuff to pagedown- it's actively developed.
